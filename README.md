# BASIC REACT APP

 <hr/>

## Introduction

- SURF-ON is a passion project turned into a fully functional React web application. This project was initially conceived as a static HTML and CSS website, but it has now evolved into a dynamic and engaging platform. The idea behind SURF-ON is to inspire surfing enthusiasts and, perhaps, spark the imagination of those who dream of creating their own surfing-related ventures

## Project Overview

SURF-ON initial requirements mandated the use of HTML and CSS to create a fully responsive website with a minimum of three pages or distinct sections, as a React practice I decided to take it a step further. With leveraging the power of React and Vite to breathe life into the project, making it a dynamic and engaging web application.
